# Xenforo Report API

This is an extension for Xenforo to expose an endpoint that returns a list of `active` and `open` reports.

## Usage

Generate an API key with the scope `reports:read`.

Use the endpoint `<baseURL>/api/reports` to get a list of reports.

See [Xenforo 2 API Documentation](https://xenforo.com/docs/dev/rest-api/) for more information.
